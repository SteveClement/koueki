Massive thanks to [the Pleroma project](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma)
for just existing. It's a wonderful example of how to logically
structure a large project, and I borrowed more than a few ideas from there to
make this project coherent. I hope I can contribute more to bleromo in the future
for the proliferation of #cofeculture
